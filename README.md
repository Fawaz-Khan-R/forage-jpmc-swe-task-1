# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

# Changes implemented:
There were 3 functions that were changed to perform as required. The functions are:

- getDataPoint()

The getDataPoint() was changed to include the correct formula for "price".

- getRatio()

The getRatio() was changed to include an escape condition in case price_b had 0 as its value. (ZeroDivisionError)

- main()

We include a dict() to store the right values for the getRatio() so that the correct values for the stock prices can be printed.
